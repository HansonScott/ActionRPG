Game Mechanics:
- AI - if off, then they don't respond.  If on, they all attack each other. 
	need to establish a 'neutral' AI
	this is because a randomly generated actor has a random alignment.  
	If alignment set to evil, they don't attach each other.
- Ranged weapon firing 
	when firing from out of range, need to set the target location to be just within range, 
	not all the way to the target.
- apply speed effect to weapon delay
- add obstacles
	- pathing around obstacle
	- apply LOS restrictions to ranged and thrown weapons
	
UI:
- on click, create animation at point to confirm click
	- X for moving
	- crossed swords for attack
	- magic-something for spell target, etc.
